# 💰 Smart Money - Expense Tracker

Smart Money is a simple and intuitive expense tracking web app designed to help users manage their **daily, weekly, and monthly income & expenses**. The app calculates balances automatically and provides a clear overview of personal finances.  

This project is my **capstone project** for [ALX Frontend Engineering](https://www.alxafrica.com/).
